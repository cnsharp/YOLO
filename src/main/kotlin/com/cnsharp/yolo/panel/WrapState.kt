/**
 * Shared mutable state for tracking terminal references that the terminal *hard-wrapped* across consecutive
 * physical lines.
 *
 * JediTerm calls each [com.jediterm.terminal.model.hyperlinks.HyperlinkFilter] in registration order
 * for every physical line. One [WrapState] is created per terminal session and handed to every filter that
 * needs cross-line reconstruction, so:
 *
 * - [FileLinkFilter] reads the OLD [pendingPath] (captured on the *previous* line), attempts path
 *   reconstruction, and writes [continuationSpan] before returning.
 * - [TypeLinkFilter] / [MemberLinkFilter] read [pendingType] / [pendingMember] and stitch a wrapped
 *   `Class`/`Class.member` reference back together.
 * - [StackTraceLinkFilter] reads [continuationSpan] and suppresses any bare-name match that already has a
 *   correct link created by [FileLinkFilter] / [MemberLinkFilter].
 *
 * Each "pending" field is written by its owning filter at the END of a call (when a reference fragment reaches
 * the end of the line) and read at the START of the *next* call. [continuationSpan] is reset by
 * [FileLinkFilter] at the top of each line (it runs first) so it always reflects the current line.
