/**
 * A [HyperlinkFilter] decorator that drops link items overlapping text the user has *typed* but not yet
 * submitted, so the agent's input box never turns what you are typing into a hyperlink.
 *
 * A PTY gives back one undifferentiated byte stream: the agent's own output and the TUI's echo of your
 * keystrokes are indistinguishable by the time they reach the terminal buffer, so "is this the input box?"
 * cannot be answered from the output side. The only reliable signal is the bytes going *to* the PTY —
 * [TypedInputGuard] records those, and this filter excludes the matching region of the line.
 *
 * Everything else (the agent's output, the transcript) keeps its links exactly as before.
